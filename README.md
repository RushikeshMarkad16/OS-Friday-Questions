## 🌱 Open Source Contribution Guidelines

We believe open source thrives on collaboration, and we're excited to have your help!

### 🤝 How to Contribute

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

2. **Create** a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-topic
3. Write your questions:
    - For MCQs: Include question, options (A-D), correct answer, and explanation.

    - For coding: Clearly define input/output, constraints, and sample test cases.
4. Open a Pull Request with a short summary of what you've added or updated.

## 📘 Guidelines for Questions

- ## 🧩 MCQs:
    - Should be related to any programming language OR specific technical domains (e.g., data structures, networking, databases, Object oriented programming).

    - Focus on concepts that test reasoning.

    - Provide a detailed explanation for the correct answer.

- ## 💻 Coding Questions:
    - Must be solvable using any programming language.

    - Avoid language-specific features unless relevant to the question.

    - Include sample input/output and edge cases.

- ## 🧼 Best Practices
    - Keep your contributions clean and well-formatted.
    - Use meaningful file and question titles.
    - Ensure there’s no plagiarism. Questions must be your original work.
    - Keep explanations concise but clear.
    - Keep difficulty in mind: avoid overly simple or easily searchable questions.
