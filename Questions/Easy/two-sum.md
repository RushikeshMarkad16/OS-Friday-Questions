## Question:
Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, the task is to find whether there is a pair of elements in the array whose sum is equal to target. This problem is a variation of 2Sum problem.

## Examples: 
**Input**: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2

**Output**: true

**Explanation**: There is a pair (1, -3) with the sum equal to given target, 1 + (-3) = -2.

**Input**: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0

**Output**: false
