## **✨ Contributing Guidelines**

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project\! Our goal is to build a high-quality collection of **coding questions and answers** to help developers learn, practice, and grow.

### **📚 What You Can Contribute**

- 🧠 **New Coding Questions** (with a clear problem statement, examples, and constraints)

- ✅ **Solutions to Existing Questions** (clean, well-explained code)

- 📝 **Explanations** that help learners understand the logic

- 🐛 **Fixes** for unclear questions, broken code, or incorrect answers

- 🔍 **Review or improve** existing content for clarity or completeness

---

### **💡 Guidelines for Questions**

- ## 🧩 MCQs:

  - Should be related to any programming language OR specific technical domains (e.g., data structures, networking, databases, Object oriented programming).

  - Focus on concepts that test reasoning.

  - Provide a detailed explanation for the correct answer.

- ## 💻 Coding Questions:

  - Must be solvable using any programming language.

  - Avoid language-specific features unless relevant to the question.

  - Include sample input/output and edge cases.

---

### **✅ Guidelines for Solutions**

When submitting an answer:

- Use a separate code block or separate file with **language specified** (e.g., `python`, `cpp`)

- Include **brief comments or an explanation** of the logic

- Avoid overly complex solutions unless necessary

- You can submit multiple language versions (e.g., Python, Java, C++)
